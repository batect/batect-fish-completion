# batect-fish-completion

[![Pipeline](https://github.com/batect/batect-fish-completion/workflows/Pipeline/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/batect/batect-fish-completion/actions?query=workflow%3APipeline+branch%3Amaster)

Shell tab completions for [fish](https://fishshell.com/).

## Requirements

* [Batect](https://batect.dev) v0.62 or later in your project
* [fish](https://fishshell.com/) v3.2 or later

## Installing

### With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install batect/batect/batect-fish-completion
```

### With [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

```shell
fisher add batect/batect-fish-completion
```

:warning: This installs the most recent commit, which may be unstable. To install a particular version, use `fisher add batect/batect-fish-completion@<version>`,
eg. `fisher add batect/batect-fish-completion@1.2.3`.

If you are running Fish v3.6 or later, additional setup is required after installing the completion script with Fisher.
https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9133, first included in Fish v3.6, disables auto-loading of completion scripts for commands not on `PATH`.
To resolve this, you need to source the completion script manually. For example, add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
source ~/.config/fish/completions/batect.fish
```

## How this works

In order to enable multiple projects to co-exist with different versions of Batect (and corresponding different available options), the completion script
in this repository acts as a proxy to the completion script generated by the appropriate version of Batect.

[The original RFC for shell tab completion](https://github.com/batect/batect/blob/master/rfcs/2020-03-shell-tab-completion/proposal.md) has further explanation.
